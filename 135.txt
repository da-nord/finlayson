ASSIGNMENT 7 - sales_data_randomizer.py
135.py

sales_data.csv is attached to this lesson
135.csv

Objective:
you've been hired by a company 
make backups of original sales.csv in separate dir
shuffle their sales records sales.csv
randomize order of rows in sales.csv  
every day at specific time 


Tasks:
1 use csv library read/write csv files
2 use random library to shuffle rows except header
3 use time library to wait and run randomizing operation every day at a specific time for sake of this assignment you can use shorter time span like 10 seconds to demonstrate functionality
4 use the shutil library to copy original files to backup directory before randomizing them

Steps:
1 read  sales data from csv file
2 use shutil to copy this original file to backup dir 
3 shuffle rows of sales data using random.shuffle() function
4 write shuffled data back to original csv file
5 use time.sleep()to wait for certain duration (e.g. 10 seconds for demonstration purposes before repeating  operation
6 make sure that you don't backup already randomized data you should keep track of whether you've already backed up today's file

Extra Challenge:
- add logging mechanism to log each time you perform shuffle and backup include timestamps and any errors that might occur
- allow for the program to be configured for different csv files and backup intervals
